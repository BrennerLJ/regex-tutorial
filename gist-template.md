## Regex Components

### Anchors

Special characters in expressions that assert specific positions in a string without matching any actual characters. They ensure that pattern matches at the beginning or ending of a string.

### Quantifiers

Specify the number of times a pattern should be matched. They can be greedy or lazy.

### OR Operator

Used to match one pattern or another. Represented with the '|' symbol. Ex. Matching either "cat" or "dog". 

### Character Classes

Used to match a set of characters.

### Flags

Modifiers that can be added to the regex to change its behavior.

### Grouping and Capturing

Used to group parts of a pattern together and capture them for later use.

### Bracket Expressions

Used to match a set of characters.

### Greedy and Lazy Match

Greedy match tries to match as many characters as possible, of a pattern, while lazy match tries to match as few characters as possible.

### Boundaries

Used to match specific positions in a string.

### Back-references

Used to match the same text that was matched by a previous group.

### Look-ahead and Look-behind

Used to assert that a pattern is or is not present without including it in the match.
